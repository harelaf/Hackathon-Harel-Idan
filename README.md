# Hackathon Client-Server Project

## About The Project

This is a client-server application for the Hackathon of the Introduction to Data Communications course.
The server waits for 2 clients to connect to it. The server sends a math problem to the clients which they need to solve. The faster client wins.
Both the client and server need to be able to communicate with the clients and servers of the other students in the course.
This project was written for the "Introduction to Data Communications" course.
